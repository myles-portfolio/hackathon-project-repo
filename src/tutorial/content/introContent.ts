            Common Approaches to Software Development
        </h2>
        <p class="py-2">
            Developing software is an art and science that involves various approaches, each with its strengths and optimal use cases. Let's take a look at three common approaches used solo developers and both small and large teams:
        </p>
        <ul class="py-2">
            <li class="py-2">
                <strong>Waterfall üåä:</strong> Waterfall is the traditional phase-oriented methodology. It's like a step-by-step recipe where you complete one step before moving on to the next. Think of it as a waterfall flowing downstream, where each phase cascades into the next, from requirements to maintenance.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
                <strong>Agile üåÄ:</strong> Agile is a flexible, practice-oriented approach. Picture a series of loops or cycles, where planning, development, and evaluation happen in quick, repetitive rounds. It's like preparing dishes in a professional kitchen‚Äîfast, adaptable, and customer-focused, with continuous tasting and improvement.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
                <strong>Extreme Programming (XP) ‚öôÔ∏è:</strong> XP is a subset of Agile that emphasizes technical best practices and high-quality results through a set of defined practices. Imagine a set of gears working together seamlessly or a team sport where close collaboration and quick passes lead to a score. It's all about constant communication, feedback, and refinement.
